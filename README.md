# Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Regression Models


## Project Overview
This project involves predicting fuel efficiency using various regression models. The goal was to preprocess the data, train different machine learning models, and select the best-performing model based on the R² score.

### What I Did:
- Selected the **Target5** variable based on the roll number --102203679.
- Preprocessed the dataset with techniques like outlier removal, normalization, and transformation.
- Split the dataset into **70% training** and **30% testing**.
- Trained multiple regression models and selected the best model based on R² performance.
- Analyzed the model's performance with visualizations (error plots, learning curves, feature importance).


### Features and Target:
- **Features**: Various columns representing engine performance, fuel consumption, and vehicle characteristics.
- **Target Variable**: Fuel Efficiency (Target5).
